# ML-Based-House-Price-Predictor
 ML and Django based web-app that predicts price of houses.
 
***First step***, build a model using sklearn and linear regression using home prices dataset from kaggle.com.  
***Second step***, build a python django web server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.  
***Third step***, is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python django server to retrieve the predicted price.  

During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.

## Tools
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code
6) Python django for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript
